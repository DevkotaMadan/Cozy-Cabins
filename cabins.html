				Lakeside Cabin Rentals BC
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>We have 7 cabins, all with their own unique rustic character, coupled with all the amenities for comfort. Each cabin has electricity, its own hot water tank, a deck with deck furniture, a propane barbecue, a picnic table and a private fire pit. The kitchens are all equipped with a full size refrigerator, a 4-burner stovetop and/or oven, a microwave, pots and pans, dishes, cutlery, a coffee maker, a hot water kettle, dish soap and tea towels. Each cabin also comes with a bathroom with shower and a wood stove for heating.</p>
				<p>Please keep in mind that these cabins are housekeeping cabins. The beds all have bottom sheets on them, but guests are asked to bring the rest of their bedding, pillows, and bath/beach towels. For those unable to do this we have bedding and bath towels here for rent</p>

				The Ark Lodge
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>We chose the name "The Ark" for the main house/lodge because every cabin is named after an animal and the main house sort of looks like an Ark and it suited the name ðŸ™‚ The Ark is more akin to a gorgeous lodge that you would see somewhere in a hunting magazine. It's never been rented before and it sits on top of the hill when you first enter the property. It boasts of over 3500 sq feet with a huge kitchen, family place with the coolest fireplace, and a master bedroom that lets you gaze at the stars while lying in bed.</p>
				<p>Whether you decide to rent this in the summer or winter your experience will be magical. And since it is significantly larger than a cabin you can fit two families. Of course, the kitchens and bathrooms are on a whole different level than the cabins. The pictures don't do it justice but at least you can get a good idea. The Ark has its own wood burning hot tub that isn't shared with any other cabins. And it has loft with a sectional sofa that you could use as another bed.</p>

				Cougar Cabin
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>Our Cougar cabin is popular with small retreats, honeymoon couples, and guests requesting a larger cabin with more room, both inside and out. This cabin boasts a leather sofa, a Lazy-boy soft rocker, a large dining table, 3 sleeping areas, a wrap-around deck and a hot tub open during the low season months. The hot tub is closed during the hotter summer months. The fire pit and picnic area has lots of room, with the grassy meadow surrounding it.</p>

				Lynx Cabin
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>The Lynx cabin is our newest cabin. This cabin is less rustic than the other cabins and sits in the back meadow area of the resort. It is in a quiet area, is only a short walk to the lake, and you can watch your kids play on the play structure from this cabin. It does not have a view of the lake, but the grassy meadow stretches wide in front of this cabin, making it a great place for family outdoor games. It is also the only cabin with a washing machine inside the cabin.</p>

				ELK Cabin
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>The Elk cabin is one of our most private cabins, siting in a location overlooking the large meadow, but less than a minute walk to the lake. This cabin is a good choice for families with small children, as it is all one level and the shower has a small built in seat and tub, making it easier for bathing smaller children.</p>

				Moose Cabin
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>The Moose cabin sits right above the lake with the Beaver cabin not far to the left of this cabin. In between these cabins is a playhouse and sandbox for the children. This cabin is sometimes used for larger families as it has 3 sleeping areas. The complementary rowboat is tied to a dock only a few yards from this cabin and the rope swing into the lake hangs next to this dock.</p>

				Beaver Cabin
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>The Beaver cabin sits right above the lake with the Moose cabin not far from it on one side and a forest on the other side. It is generally considered a quieter area, as it is a little farther from the main beach and meadow area, yet still within an easy walk. The complementary rowboat is tied to a dock only a few yards from this cabin and the rope swing into the lake hangs next to this dock.</p>

				Deer Cabin
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>The Deer cabin is our smallest, but one of our most popular cabins because of its close proximity to the lake and its log cabin rustic charm. It has a large picture window facing East toward the lake and the Deer cabinâ€™s veranda is a favourite place to enjoy that first morning coffee while watching the sun rise and the baby ducklings splashing in the lake. Guests are able to use the large covered fire pit that sits next to the cabin and close to the lake and there is a complementary rowboat tied to a dock within only a few yards from this cabin. This cabin is a pet free cabin.</p>

				Bear Cabin
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>The Bear cabin sits close to the Deer cabin and also close to the lake and beach area. The kitchen looks out over the large meadow on one side of the cabin, while on the other side, towering evergreens begin their stretch up the mountain. Parents often like this cabin as they can watch their kids from the front porch playing on the beach, in the lake or in the meadow. Like the Deer cabin, the climb to the loft is more of a ladder climb, so this cabin is best suited for children who are comfortable with the steeper climb to the loft.</p>

				Trapper's Cabin
				Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
				<p>Very unique trappers cabin on property with a private lake. This cabin is a rustic experience yet you have a toilet/shower/sink right next door that you can use. If you are looking for a very cool camping experience that's unlike anything else than this might fit your bill. The walk to the private lake is only 5 min where you can fish (catch and release). There's another very good fishing lake only a 15 min walk away..</p>
